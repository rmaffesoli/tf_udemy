Tensorflow:

- Tensorflow is a library used to incorporate machine learning into projects by providing APIs and data
- Tensors are basic units of data and are arrays of primitive values
- Programs have 2 sections: building graph with nodes, and running the graph
- Building:
    - Build a graph of nodes, each takes 0+ tensors as input
    - Specify model type, input parameters, expected output, and parameters we want model to optimize
    - Might also want some training data and some testing data
- Running:
    - Run the session on our graph to output any results
    - Specify how many times we want our model to run
    - First train with training data then use testing data to assess accuracy
- One of the simplest models is linear regression. We basically estimate a line that fits some data and run our model
    until the line adjusts to best fit the data, but more on this later
